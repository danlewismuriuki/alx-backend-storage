0x00-MySQL_Advanced
Project Overview
The 0x00-MySQL_Advanced directory delves into advanced MySQL topics, focusing on optimizing database operations and implementing complex features. This section is designed to provide a deeper understanding of MySQLâ€™s capabilities and to enhance skills in database management.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and implement the following concepts without external help:

1. Creating Tables with Constraints
Learn how to define various constraints when creating tables to ensure data integrity and enforce rules. Understand the use of primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.

2. Optimizing Queries by Adding Indexes
Explore how to improve query performance through the use of indexes. Understand different types of indexes and when to apply them for optimizing database queries.

3. Stored Procedures and Functions in MySQL
Understand what stored procedures and functions are, and how to implement them in MySQL. Learn how to create reusable SQL code blocks to perform operations and calculations.

4. Views in MySQL
Learn about views, which are virtual tables based on the result of a query. Understand how to create, use, and manage views to simplify complex queries and enhance security.

5. Triggers in MySQL
Explore triggers, which are automated responses to database events. Learn how to create triggers to enforce business rules, perform validations, and automate tasks.
